A sprint is a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review.

Each sprint consists of  
  * a planning meeting. During the meeting, the product owner (the person requesting the work) and the development team agree upon exactly what work will be accomplished during the sprint. 
    The development team has the final say when it comes to determining how much work can realistically be accomplished during the sprint, and the product owner has the final say on what criteria 
    need to be met for the work to be approved and accepted. In sprint meetings (on Fridays) *one of the team members in CS340 will have to play the role of the product owner.*
  * a two-week development period
  * during the sprint, the team holds MWF stand up meeting to discuss progress and brainstorm solutions to challenges. Only project manager has 
    the power to interrupt or stop the sprint. *The project manager will be either permanent or temporary assignment CS340 teams.*
  * at the end of the sprint, the team presents its completed work to the product owner and the product owner uses the criteria established at the sprint planning meeting to either accept or reject the work.
  
  
We will use github issues to track sprints. 
   - For you class project repo create milestones for each sprint
   - For the first milestone create issues for each project participant describing their work during the sprint.
